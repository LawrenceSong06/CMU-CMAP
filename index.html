                            From 1977 to 1978, we successfully enrolled 140 minority students in CIT, 
                                successfully increased the representation of minority students in previously
                                white-dominated schools.

                            CMAP has also encouraged minority female students to enter new fields,
                                including science and engineering. We enrolled 35 female minority students in
                                CIT/MIS in 1978, comparing to 0 in 1968.
                            Our trained minority women are among the most actively sought members of
                                today's job market.

                            CMAP graduates achieved great success in the job market--they have an employment
                                of about 100% in a depressed job market. They are working in a variety of industries including
                                Chemistry, Engineering, AMS, Psychology, English, Economics, Drama, Music, and Design.
